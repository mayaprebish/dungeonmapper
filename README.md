# Dungeon Mapper
#### A game about an explorer meticulously mapping out a dungeon.

### Dev Log
April 10 2021:
> Decided I wanted to make a dungeon crawler.
> Started planning and experimenting with Processing 3, a language/IDE I had fun using in my high school CS courses

April 11-19 2021:
> Decided I wanted to create a dungeon mapping mechanic.
> Created data types for map cells/dungeon screens, and helper functions for walking, switching screens, animating the player, drawing backgrounds, opening the map, changing pen colors, etc.
> Drew a whole bunch of pixel art.

April 20 2021:
> Started the transition to p5.js, so I could host the game on my portfolio.
